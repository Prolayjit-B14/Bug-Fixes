# Bug-Fixes

A project for Solution Challenge 2025 organised by Google Develpoer Group, India.

Problem Statement :
Library & Tool for analysis & synthesis of Indian Classical Music

This uses a neural & symbolic processing to analyze and synthesize Indian Classical music. Certain parts are done in traditional speech processing for recognition and analysis of audio signals. Some of them are done using symbolic processing for generating & synthesizing notes. Finally some neural (transformer/latent diffusion based models) for parsing and synthesizing audio.

Objective:
This use case addresses the problem of analysis and synthesis of Indian Classical Music. The AI-based solution uses a combination of neural and symbolic processing to analyze and synthesize Indian Classical music. Certain parts are done in traditional speech processing for recognition and analysis of audio signals. Some of them are done using symbolic processing for generating & synthesizing notes. Finally some neural (transformer/latent diffusion based models) for parsing and synthesizing audio.

## How to run this project in local system ?

### Step 1: Make sure you have NodeJS installed

#### run

```sh
node --version
```

if this command returns any version of Node, it means NodeJS is already installed.

#### if the previous command doesn't return the version of node, install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

### Step 2: Clone the git repository in your system.

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/Prolayjit-B14/Bug-Fixes"
```

### Step 3: change your current working directory to the project directory.

```sh
cd Bug-Fixes
```

### Step 4: Run the server in development mode.

```sh
npm run dev #development mode
```

### Congrats! Your server will be running at port `6001` i.e, `http://localhost:6001`.

## [IMPORTANT] To stop the server which is already running, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal. Do this to avoid unexpected errors.
